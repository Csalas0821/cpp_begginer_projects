## Simple Guessing Game in C++ 23

<text>This is a very simple project I used to learn the very basics of cpp and how it generates *random numbers*.</text>

# Getting it to Work

- 1st Option: Compile random_num.cpp for linux with:
clang++ -std=c++23 -o /bin/guess_game random_num.cpp

Compile for Windows with:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -std=c++23 -o bin/guess_game.exe random_num.cpp


- 2nd Option: Just run the corresponding binary (executable) to your OS.
