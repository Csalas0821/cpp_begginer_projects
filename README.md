# Simple Guessing Game in C++ 23

This is a very simple project I used to learn the very basics of cpp and how it generates *random numbers*.
## Getting it to Work

- 1st Option: 

Compile random_num.cpp for linux with:
<pre> ```bash clang++ -std=c++23 -o bin/guess_game_linux random_num.cpp ``` </pre>

Compile for Windows with: \n
  <pre> ```bash x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -std=c++23 -o bin/guess_game.exe random_num.cpp ``` </pre>

- 2nd Option:

Just run the corresponding binary (executable) to your OS.
