# Salas' Begginer Projects

Welcome to my humble repository. Here's is where I will publish my first projects in C++ 23. Some are just toy programs and other college projects rewritten from Python, Prolog and MIPS Assembly.

Now there's: 
	- Guessing Game

But the following projects will be eventually added:
	- Binomial Coefficient Calculator
	- Matrix Multiplication (Dot & Hadamard) Calculator
	- 8 Queens problem Solver
	- Tetris Game
	- Password Generator
	- A full Chess Engine

If you're interesed in more Complex things like AI, GPU Acceleration or Full-Stack Application, stay engaged, because that's what's coming next. It will be lots of fun seeing how I learn CUDA.
